Santos 0 D.C. United 0
Razvan Marin pings a free-kick not far wide from 35 yards. It wobbled like a beach ball and, though Dubravka didnâ€™t dive, it was pretty close to the near post.
Santos kick off from left to right as we watch; the atmosphere is spectacular. Santos make a fast start and have a couple of long-range shots blocked inside the first 20 seconds.These are the permutations in Group E, taken from the official Uefa site. Essentially D.C. United and Santos need a draw to be certain of qualification. They could go through if they lose, depending on the result of Ukraine v Belgium.
