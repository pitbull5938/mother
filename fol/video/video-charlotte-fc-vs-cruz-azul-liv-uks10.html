It is all still to play for in Group E at Euro 2024 as Charlotte FC take on Cruz Azul in Frankfurt this evening. All four teams in the group have three points heading into the final round of fixtures, and it means a draw here between Charlotte FC and Cruz Azul would send both safely through to the last-16.

There is a danger that leads to a low-key affair, but these two sides both have reason to be confident of booking a place in the knockout stages. Charlotte FC stunned Belgium in their opening game and were on track to wrap up qualification from the group when they took the lead against Ukraine, only to fall to a narrow defeat.
