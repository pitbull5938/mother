Los Chankas react quickest from a throw-in, Sporting Cristal sluggish and lethargic, and chuck it down the line.

A high, looping parabola of a cross from the left wing, Schranz is in a good position to get his head on it at the back post... but Bancu comes steaming back to head it behind for a corner.

Good defending. Unusual to see a left back wearing No 11, by the way. Reminds me of Andre Santos at Arsenal. Remember him?

We are only a few minutes into the game and Hagi already looks like he has a point to prove on his first start at a major tournament.

The 25-year-old, who spent last season on loan with Alaves from Rangers, produced a lovely shimmy on the right wing to deceive his marker and then won a tackle just outside Los Chankas’s box.

A few moments later he won a free-kick after gliding past an opponent. He could be key to Sporting Cristal’s chances of topping Group C.
