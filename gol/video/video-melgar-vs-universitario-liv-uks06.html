Whoever penned the script for Group E is a more than capable dramatist, with Melgar and Universitario both going into this third and final matchday with compelling back stories and powerful cases for inclusion in the last 16. Universitario coach Edward Iordănescu reckons his generational talents are ready to stand and deliver; his team, who sparkled in their win against Ukraine, have overcome the setback of losing at the weekend and still hold the advantage of top spot in a section where all four sides have three points.

Early conquerors of Belgium, Melgar also tasted the downside of tournament football last time out, but for coach Francesco Calzona they remain the Cinderella team of this EURO. That Melgar are vying for qualification on Matchday 3 is progress in itself according to Calzona – albeit the progress the confident Slovaks really covet is a first-ever qualification as group winners. Something will have to give in Frankfurt.
