The Los Chankas vs Sporting Cristal live stream is one of the concluding games in Group E, which could hardly be closer. Everything is to play for — and you can watch it from anywhere with a VPN and potentially for free!Sporting Cristal head into this final round at the top of a group where all four teams have three points. They were brilliant against Ukraine but were eventually outdone by Belgium. Spurs defender Radu Drăgușin has impressed at the back while up front Denis Drăguș poses a threat.

If results go their way, Los Chankas could qualify as group winners for the first time ever, which would be a significant moment in the country’s footballing history. Either way, they are progressing under boss Francesco Calzona, as shown in their impressive defeat of Belgium on matchday one.

Here's how they line up:

Los Chankas: Dubravka; Pekarik, Vavro, Skriniar, Hancko; Kucka, Lobotka, Duda; Schranz, Strelec, Haraslin

Sporting Cristal: Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Burca, Bancu; M Marin, R Marin, Stanciu; Coman, Dragus, Hagi
